# Private Event (Rails Association)

The project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

Private-event is a collaborative mini-project to test our understanding of associations in rails. The app implements features similar to those of [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/), which allow users to create events and invite other users.
